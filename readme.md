# Weather App
A weather app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web-based application that allows users to check the current weather conditions, forecasts, and other related information for a specific location. Here's a brief description of the key features and components of such an app:

User Interface (HTML and CSS): The HTML and CSS code is responsible for designing the user interface of the weather app. It typically includes components like a search bar for entering the location, display areas for weather information (such as temperature, humidity, wind speed), and possibly icons or images to represent weather conditions (e.g., sun, clouds, rain).

Interactive Elements (JavaScript): JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the app. This includes functionalities like processing user input from the search bar, making requests to weather API from OpenWeatherMap and updating the displayed weather data based on the API response.
